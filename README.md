# Pentathlon-Next-Product-to-Buy-Modeling

**Project Description:**
In this project, I conducted an extensive analysis to predict the next product Pentathlon customers are likely to purchase. The analysis utilized a variety of machine learning models, including logistic regression, neural networks, random forests, and XGBoost, each tuned with specific hyperparameters to optimize performance. The models were tasked with analyzing customer behavior data and predicting the likelihood of a purchase based on different promotional messages. The study's goal was to determine the most effective message for each customer to enhance marketing strategies.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Data Analysis and Machine Learning:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, pyrsm
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for collaboration

**Methodology and Key Accomplishments:**
1. **Data Preparation and Analysis:**
   - Split data into training and testing sets to ensure model validation.
   - Performed exploratory data analysis using pandas to understand customer demographics and behavior.

2. **Model Development and Evaluation:**
   - Developed four types of models: Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
   - Tuned models using hyperparameter optimization to maximize the Area Under Curve (AUC) for ROC.
   - Evaluated models based on various metrics including AUC, accuracy, and precision to select the best performer for each type of message.

3. **Message Optimization Strategy:**
   - Analyzed the impact of different promotional messages on customer purchase likelihood.
   - Implemented a system to predict and maximize the expected profit by determining the optimal promotional message for each customer.

4. **Collaboration and Version Control:**
   - Utilized Git for version control and GitHub for code sharing and collaboration among team members.
   - Ensured reproducibility and consistency in code execution across different environments.

**Key Outcomes:**
- **Optimized Marketing Strategies:** Enhanced the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by tailoring messages to individual customer preferences, significantly increasing potential sales conversions.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Enabled Pentathlon to make informed decisions based on predictive analytics, improving overall customer engagement and satisfaction.
- **Automation and Scalability:** Streamlined the process of message selection for marketing purposes, making it scalable and adaptable to new data and evolving market conditions.
